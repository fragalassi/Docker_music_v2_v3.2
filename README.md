## Copy Docker requirements
Clone the repository on your computer

## Install nvidia-docker2 (https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)
  `sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2`
  `sudo pkill -SIGHUP dockerd`

## Copy Docker requirements
Copy your github ssh keys (with no passphrase in a .ssh folder in the current directory

## Build image
  `docker build .`

## Run container using nvidia runtime
  `docker run --runtime=nvidia -it CONTAINER_ID`

The CONTAINER_ID is the id displayed at the end of the build process

## Run the pipeline

## Acknowledgments

The cascaded CNN architecture at the core of the segmentation step of our pipeline was proposed by https://github.com/sergivalverde/nicMSlesions. We thank the main author S. Valverde for the positive and helpful discussions.

We thank B<>com, Rennes, for the software development collaboration, essential to translate research work into the clinical practice.

We thank Rennes CHU for the clinical feedback and extensive discussions that have helped optimizing this pipeline so to actually assist clinicians in their practice.
